[LCD Smartie](https://github.com/stokie-ant/lcdsmartie-laz) is a great windows utility for driving character LCD Screens and displaying diagnostic messages.\
The program comes with a huge amount of build in functions but it also supports plugins. An introduction to the program can be found on its old hosting [pages](https://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/) 

Here you can find few of the updated plugins and skins I've created in the period from 2005 till today.\
\
Everything is updated to work with the latest version of LCD Smartie which is build around 64bit architecture and comes with improved functionalities. 
The latest version of LCD Smartie can be found on its official github repo: https://github.com/LCD-Smartie/LCDSmartie/releases
